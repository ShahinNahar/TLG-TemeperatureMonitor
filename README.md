TLG-TemeperatureMonitor
=======================

The temperature monitor program will read temperature from a .txt file, parse the data, display the data in a graph format using Django and will send a n e-mail alert to a list of user if temperature reaches beyond certain level. 

Right now the functions are running separately as different class. Later, I will have to put it all together and make one class to run as a whole
